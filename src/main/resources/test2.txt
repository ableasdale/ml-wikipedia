'''Lepus''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|l|iː|p|ə|s}}, colloquially {{IPAc-en|ˈ|l|ɛ|p|ə|s}}) is a [[constellation]] lying just south of the [[celestial equator]], immediately south of [[Orion (constellation)|Orion]]. Its name is [[Latin]] for [[hare]].  Although the hare does not represent any particular figure in [[Greek mythology]], Lepus was one of the 48 constellations listed by the 2nd century astronomer [[Ptolemy]], and it remains one of the 88 modern constellations. It is located below the constellation Orion (the hunter), and is sometimes represented as a hare being chased by Orion or, alternatively, by Orion's hunting dogs.<ref>"Skys & Telescope: March 2008", ''Southern Hemisphere Highlights:'' by Shermend</ref>

This constellation should not be confused with [[Lupus (constellation)|Lupus]], the wolf.

== History and mythology ==
[[File:Sidney Hall - Urania's Mirror - Canis Major, Lepus, Columba Noachi & Cela Sculptoris.jpg|left|thumb|Lepus as seen in ''[[Urania's Mirror]]'' (1825)]]
Lepus is most often represented as a rabbit being hunted by [[Orion (mythology)|Orion]], whose hunting dogs ([[Canis Major]] and [[Canis Minor]]) pursue it. The constellation is also associated with some lunar mythology, including the [[Moon rabbit]].{{sfn|Ridpath|Tirion|2001|pp=170-171}}

Four stars of this constellation (α, β, γ, δ Lep) form a quadrilateral and are known as ''‘Arsh al-[[Orion (constellation)|Jawzā']]'', "the Throne of Jawzā'" or ''Kursiyy al-Jawzā' al-Mu'akhkhar'', "the Hindmost Chair of Jawzā'" and ''al-Nihāl'', "the [[Camel]]s Quenching Their Thirst" in [[Arabic]].

[[Image:LepusCC.jpg|thumb|left|200px|The constellation Lepus as it can be seen by the naked eye.]]
There are a fair number of bright stars, both single and double, in Lepus. [[Alpha Leporis]], the brightest star of Lepus, is a [[white supergiant]] of magnitude 2.6, 1300 light-years from Earth. Its traditional name, Arneb, means "hare". [[Beta Leporis]], called Nihal, is a [[yellow giant]] of magnitude 2.8, 159 light-years from Earth. [[Gamma Leporis]] is a double star divisible in binoculars. The primary is a yellow star of magnitude 3.6, 29 light-years from Earth. The secondary is an orange star of magnitude 6.2. [[Delta Leporis]] is a yellow giant of magnitude 3.8, 112 light-years from Earth. [[Epsilon Leporis]] is an [[orange giant]] of magnitude 3.2,<ref>{{cite journal | display-authors=1 | last1=Gutierrez-Moreno | first1=Adelina | last2=Moreno | first2=H. | last3=Stock | first3=J. | last4=Torres | first4=C. | last5=Wroblewski | first5=H. | title=A System of photometric standards | publisher=Publicaciones Universidad de Chile, Department de Astronomy | volume=1 | pages=1–17 | date=1966 | bibcode=1966PDAUC...1....1G }}</ref> 227 light-years from Earth. [[Kappa Leporis]] is a double star divisible in medium aperture amateur telescopes, 560 light-years from Earth. The primary is a blue-white star of magnitude 4.4 and the secondary is a star of magnitude 7.4.{{sfn|Ridpath|Tirion|2001|pp=170-171}}

There are several [[variable star]]s in Lepus. [[R Leporis]] is a [[Mira variable]] star also called "Hind's Crimson Star" for its striking red color. It varies in magnitude from a minimum of 9.8 to a maximum of 7.3, with a period of 420 days. R Leporis is at a distance of 1500 light-years. The color intensifies as the star brightens.<ref>{{citation |title = Deep Sky Objects |last = Levy |first = David H. |publisher = Prometheus Books |date = 2005 |isbn = 1-59102-361-0}}</ref> It can be as dim as magnitude 12 and as bright as magnitude 5.5. It was named for [[John Russell Hind]].{{sfn|Ridpath|Tirion|2001|pp=170-171}} T Leporis is also a Mira variable observed in detail by [[ESO]]'s [[Very Large Telescope]] [[Interferometer]].<ref>Unique Details Of Double Star In Orion Nebula And Star T Leporis Captured By 'Virtual' Telescope. ScienceDaily. Retrieved February 19, 2009, [http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2009/02/090218103517.htm]</ref> [[RX Leporis]] is a [[semiregular variable star|semi-regular]] [[red giant]] that has a period of 2 months. It has a minimum magnitude of 7.4 and a maximum magnitude of 5.0.{{sfn|Ridpath|Tirion|2001}}

===Deep-sky objects===
There is one [[Messier object]] in Lepus, [[Messier 79|M79]]. It is a [[globular cluster]] of magnitude 8.0, 42,000 light-years from Earth. One of the few globular clusters visible in the Northern Hemisphere winter, it is a Shapley class V cluster, which means that it has an intermediate concentration towards its center. It is often described as having a "[[starfish]]" shape. M79 was discovered in 1780 by [[Pierre Méchain]].{{sfn|Levy|2005|pp=160-161}}
